# Product Overview

## Product Purpose

FivcAdvisor is an intelligent multi-agent ecosystem built on the Strands framework that enables autonomous task assessment, dynamic tool generation, and flexible agent orchestration. It solves the problem of rigid, single-purpose AI assistants by providing a flexible system where specialized agents can collaborate, dynamically select tools, and adapt to complex, multi-faceted tasks.

The core problem it addresses is the limitation of traditional AI assistants that:
- Cannot assess task complexity and adapt their approach accordingly
- Lack the ability to dynamically discover and use the right tools
- Cannot break down complex tasks into coordinated sub-tasks
- Require manual configuration for each new use case

- **Community Contributions**: Number of custom agents and tools shared
  - Target: 20+ community contributions in first year

## Product Principles

1. **Modularity Over Monoliths**
   - Every component should be independently usable and composable
   - Avoid tight coupling between agents, tools, and models
   - Enable users to mix and match components for their specific needs

2. **Intelligence Through Specialization**
   - Specialized agents outperform general-purpose ones for specific tasks
   - Each agent should have a clear, focused purpose
   - Coordination between specialists beats a single generalist

3. **Transparency and Observability**
   - Users should understand what agents are doing and why
   - Tool usage and decision-making should be visible
   - Provide clear feedback on task progress and outcomes

4. **Extensibility by Default**
   - The system should be easy to extend with new agents and tools
   - Use standard protocols (MCP) for tool integration
   - Provide clear patterns for custom agent creation

5. **Pragmatic Automation**
   - Automate what can be automated, but keep humans in the loop for critical decisions
   - Provide both autonomous and interactive modes
   - Balance convenience with control

6. **Performance and Responsiveness**
   - Async execution for non-blocking user experience
   - Efficient tool retrieval and agent selection
   - Minimize latency in interactive sessions
