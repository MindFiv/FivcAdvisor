  "content": "# Product Overview\n\n## Product Purpose\n\nFivcAdvisor is an intelligent multi-agent ecosystem built on the Strands framework that enables autonomous task assessment, dynamic tool generation, and flexible agent orchestration. It solves the problem of rigid, single-purpose AI assistants by providing a flexible system where specialized agents can collaborate, dynamically select tools, and adapt to complex, multi-faceted tasks.\n\nThe core problem it addresses is the limitation of traditional AI assistants that:\n- Cannot assess task complexity and adapt their approach accordingly\n- Lack the ability to dynamically discover and use the right tools\n- Cannot break down complex tasks into coordinated sub-tasks\n- Require manual configuration for each new use case\n\n## Target Users\n\n### Primary Users\n\n1. **Developers and Engineers**\n   - Need: Intelligent coding assistance, task automation, and tool orchestration\n   - Pain Points: Managing multiple tools, coordinating complex workflows, repetitive task execution\n\n2. **Data Scientists and Researchers**\n   - Need: Pattern analysis, workflow optimization, and automated experimentation\n   - Pain Points: Manual data processing, repetitive analysis tasks, tool integration complexity\n\n3. **Technical Teams**\n   - Need: Collaborative problem-solving, task planning, and execution coordination\n   - Pain Points: Communication overhead, task distribution, progress tracking\n\n### Secondary Users\n\n4. **System Administrators**\n   - Need: Automated system monitoring, task scheduling, and operational assistance\n   - Pain Points: Manual monitoring, alert fatigue, routine task execution\n\n5. **Product Managers**\n   - Need: Task assessment, planning assistance, and progress visibility\n   - Pain Points: Understanding technical complexity, resource allocation, timeline estimation\n\n## Key Features\n\n1. **Intelligent Task Assessment**\n   - Automatic evaluation of task complexity and requirements\n   - Determines whether planning, tool retrieval, or direct execution is needed\n   - Provides immediate answers for simple queries while orchestrating complex workflows\n\n2. **Dynamic Tool Management**\n   - Automatic tool discovery and registration\n   - Semantic search for relevant tools based on task requirements\n   - Support for both built-in tools and MCP (Model Context Protocol) tools\n   - Tool combination and composition capabilities\n\n3. **Specialized Agent System**\n   - 8+ specialized agent types (Generic, Companion, Consultant, Planner, Researcher, Engineer, Evaluator, etc.)\n   - Each agent optimized for specific tasks and workflows\n   - Dynamic agent creation and configuration\n   - Multi-agent coordination through Swarm capabilities\n\n4. **Interactive Web Interface**\n   - Modern Streamlit-based chat interface\n   - Real-time async execution with non-blocking UI\n   - Conversation history and session management\n   - Tool usage visualization and progress tracking\n\n5. **Flexible LLM Support**\n   - Multiple provider support (OpenAI, Ollama, custom)\n   - Model-specific optimization for different agent types\n   - Configurable model selection per agent\n\n6. **Vector-Based Tool Retrieval**\n   - ChromaDB-powered semantic search\n   - Intelligent tool recommendation based on task context\n   - Efficient tool discovery across large tool libraries\n\n7. **Extensible Architecture**\n   - Plugin-based tool system\n   - Custom agent creation with decorators\n   - Modular component design\n   - Easy integration of new capabilities\n\n8. **Command-Line Interface**\n   - Rich CLI for direct agent interaction\n   - Multiple agent types accessible via simple commands\n   - System information and management utilities\n\n## Business Objectives\n\n- **Democratize AI Agent Technology**: Make sophisticated multi-agent systems accessible to developers without requiring deep AI expertise\n- **Accelerate Development Workflows**: Reduce time spent on repetitive tasks and tool coordination by 50%+\n- **Enable Autonomous Tool Evolution**: Create a self-improving system where agents can identify needs and generate new tools\n- **Foster Innovation**: Provide a platform for experimenting with agent-based workflows and discovering new use cases\n- **Build Community**: Establish an ecosystem where users can share agents, tools, and patterns\n\n## Success Metrics\n\n- **User Adoption**: Number of active users and installations\n  - Target: 1,000+ active users in first 6 months\n\n- **Task Completion Rate**: Percentage of user tasks successfully completed\n  - Target: 85%+ success rate for well-defined tasks\n\n- **Tool Ecosystem Growth**: Number of available tools (built-in + MCP + custom)\n  - Target: 50+ tools within first year\n\n- **Agent Utilization**: Distribution of agent usage across different types\n  - Target: Balanced usage indicating diverse use cases\n\n- **User Engagement**: Average session length and return rate\n  - Target: 15+ minute average sessions, 60%+ weekly return rate\n\n- **Community Contributions**: Number of custom agents and tools shared\n  - Target: 20+ community contributions in first year\n\n## Product Principles\n\n1. **Modularity Over Monoliths**\n   - Every component should be independently usable and composable\n   - Avoid tight coupling between agents, tools, and models\n   - Enable users to mix and match components for their specific needs\n\n2. **Intelligence Through Specialization**\n   - Specialized agents outperform general-purpose ones for specific tasks\n   - Each agent should have a clear, focused purpose\n   - Coordination between specialists beats a single generalist\n\n3. **Transparency and Observability**\n   - Users should understand what agents are doing and why\n   - Tool usage and decision-making should be visible\n   - Provide clear feedback on task progress and outcomes\n\n4. **Extensibility by Default**\n   - The system should be easy to extend with new agents and tools\n   - Use standard protocols (MCP) for tool integration\n   - Provide clear patterns for custom agent creation\n\n5. **Pragmatic Automation**\n   - Automate what can be automated, but keep humans in the loop for critical decisions\n   - Provide both autonomous and interactive modes\n   - Balance convenience with control\n\n6. **Performance and Responsiveness**\n   - Async execution for non-blocking user experience\n   - Efficient tool retrieval and agent selection\n   - Minimize latency in interactive sessions\n\n## Monitoring & Visibility\n\n### Current Implementation\n\n- **Dashboard Type**: Web-based Streamlit interface\n- **Real-time Updates**: Async execution with streaming responses\n- **Key Metrics Displayed**:\n  - Conversation history and context\n  - Active agent type and configuration\n  - Tool usage and execution results\n  - Session state and progress\n- **Sharing Capabilities**: Local session management (future: export conversations, share sessions)\n\n### CLI Monitoring\n\n- **Command-line Interface**: Rich terminal output with formatted responses\n- **System Information**: `fivcadvisor info` command for system status\n- **Logging**: Structured logging for debugging and analysis\n\n## Future Vision\n\nFivcAdvisor aims to evolve into a self-improving agent ecosystem where:\n\n1. **Autonomous Tool Generation**: Agents identify recurring patterns and automatically create composite tools\n2. **Collaborative Agent Networks**: Multiple users' agents can collaborate on shared tasks\n3. **Learning and Optimization**: System learns from usage patterns to improve agent selection and tool recommendations\n4. **Enterprise Features**: Team collaboration, access control, and audit logging\n\n### Potential Enhancements\n\n- **Remote Access**: \n  -
