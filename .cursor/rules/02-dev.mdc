# Development Workflow

## Commands
- Format: `make format` (Ruff)
- Lint: `make lint` (Ruff)
- Test: `make test` (Pytest)
- Dev sync: `make dev` (uv sync with dev extras)

## Conventions
- Prefer explicit names; annotate function signatures
- Use Pydantic models for flow state
- Guard clauses; avoid deep nesting
- Never commit secrets; use env vars
- Keep tests deterministic; mock CrewAI/LLM

## Pre-commit (manual)
Run before committing:
```bash
make format && make lint && make test
```
