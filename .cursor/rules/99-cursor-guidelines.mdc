# Cursor Editing Guidelines

- Keep changes within `src/crewai_hatchery` unless modifying tooling/tests/README
- If adding CLI options, update `README.md` and add tests
- Prefer minimal dependencies; if adding, declare in `pyproject.toml` and ensure `make install` still works
- After structural edits (flows/agents/tasks), ensure `make test` passes
- Avoid calls to external APIs in tests; use mocks
