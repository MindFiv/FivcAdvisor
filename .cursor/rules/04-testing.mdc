# Testing

## Pytest guidelines
- Keep tests deterministic and fast
- Mock `crewai_hatchery.llms.create_*` and `Crew` interactions
- For new flows, add tests for assessment, routing, and both execution branches

## Running tests
```bash
make test
```

## Coverage (optional)
- Consider adding coverage later; not configured yet
