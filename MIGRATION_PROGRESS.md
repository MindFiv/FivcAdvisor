# Strands → LangChain Migration Progress

## 📊 Overall Status

**Current Phase**: Phase 4 (Multi-Agent) ✅ **COMPLETE**
**Overall Progress**: 40% (2 of 5 phases complete)
**Timeline**: On track for 4-5 week completion

---

## ✅ Completed Phases

### Phase 1: 准备工作 (Week 1) ✅ COMPLETE
- [x] Created feature branch `feature/langchain-migration`
- [x] Installed LangChain dependencies:
  - langchain==1.0.2
  - langchain-core==1.0.0
  - langchain-openai==1.0.1
  - langgraph==0.6.11
  - langgraph-swarm==0.0.14 (upgraded from 0.0.2)
- [x] Created adapters directory structure
- [x] Set up test framework

### Phase 4: 多智能体 (Week 4.5) ⭐ ✅ COMPLETE
- [x] Created `LangGraphSwarmAdapter` class
  - Wraps LangGraph Swarm with Strands-compatible API
  - Supports multiple agents with default agent selection
  - Provides `invoke_async()` and `invoke()` methods
  
- [x] Implemented `create_langchain_swarm()` factory function
  - Maintains backward compatibility
  - Accepts agents list and optional default agent name
  
- [x] Updated `create_generic_agent_swarm()` function
  - Now uses LangGraphSwarmAdapter instead of Strands Swarm
  - Maintains same interface for existing code
  
- [x] Created comprehensive test suite
  - 11 unit tests, all passing ✅
  - Tests cover adapter creation, agent storage, API compatibility
  - Uses mocking to avoid dependency on real LangChain agents

## 🔄 In Progress / Pending Phases

### Phase 2: 核心适配 (Week 2-3) ⏳ NOT STARTED
**Objective**: Implement model, tool, and event system adapters

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Create model adapter layer (`adapters/models.py`)
  - Migrate from Strands models to LangChain models
  - Support OpenAI, Ollama, LiteLLM
  
- [ ] Create tool system adapter (`adapters/tools.py`)
  - Adapt Strands tool definitions to LangChain format
  - Maintain MCP integration
  
- [ ] Create event system (`adapters/events.py`)
  - Implement EventBus to replace Strands hooks
  - Support agent lifecycle events

**Estimated Duration**: 2 weeks

### Phase 3: Agent 系统 (Week 4) ⏳ NOT STARTED
**Objective**: Migrate 9 agent factory functions

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Migrate 9 specialized agent creators:
  1. Generic Agent
  2. Companion Agent
  3. ToolRetriever Agent
  4. Consultant Agent
  5. Planning Agent
  6. Research Agent
  7. Engineering Agent
  8. Evaluating Agent
  9. Generic Swarm (already using LangGraph)
  
- [ ] Implement conversation management
- [ ] Create integration tests

**Estimated Duration**: 1 week

### Phase 5: 测试优化 (Week 5) ⏳ NOT STARTED
**Objective**: Complete testing and documentation

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Full integration tests
- [ ] Performance benchmarking
- [ ] Documentation updates
- [ ] Migration guide for developers

**Estimated Duration**: 1 week

## 🎯 Key Achievements

1. **LangGraph Swarm Direct Replacement**: Successfully implemented adapter that allows LangGraph Swarm to directly replace Strands Swarm
2. **Backward Compatibility**: Maintained Strands API compatibility through adapter pattern
3. **Test Coverage**: 11 unit tests with 100% pass rate
4. **Dependency Upgrade**: Upgraded langgraph-swarm from 0.0.2 to 0.0.14 (latest stable)

## 🚀 Next Steps

### Immediate (This Week)
1. **Start Phase 2**: Create model adapter layer
   - Focus on OpenAI model first (most common)
   - Then Ollama and LiteLLM support
   
2. **Create tool adapter**: Adapt Strands tools to LangChain format

### Short Term (Next 2 Weeks)
1. Complete Phase 2 core adapters
2. Start Phase 3: Migrate agent factory functions
3. Begin integration testing

### Medium Term (Weeks 4-5)
1. Complete Phase 3: All 9 agents migrated
2. Phase 5: Full testing and optimization
3. Prepare for production deployment
