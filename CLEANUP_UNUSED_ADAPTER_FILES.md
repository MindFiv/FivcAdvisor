# Cleanup: Unused Adapter Files Removal

**Date**: 2025-10-25  
**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETE**

---

## Summary

Removed two unused adapter files that were created during the Strands-to-LangChain migration but are no longer needed since Strands agents have been completely removed.

---

## Files Removed

### 1. `src/fivcadvisor/tools/adapter.py` (186 lines)

**Purpose**: Tool adapter for converting between Strands tools and LangChain tools

**Functions**:
- `convert_strands_tool_to_langchain()` - Convert single Strands tool to LangChain
- `convert_strands_tools_to_langchain()` - Convert batch of Strands tools
- `is_strands_tool()` - Check if tool is Strands format
- `is_langchain_tool()` - Check if tool is LangChain format
- `adapt_tool()` - Global tool adapter function
- `adapt_tools()` - Global batch adapter function

**Classes**:
- `ToolAdapter` - Tool conversion cache and batch operations

**Reason for Removal**:
- ❌ No imports found anywhere in the codebase
- ❌ Not exported from `src/fivcadvisor/tools/__init__.py`
- ❌ Strands agents completely removed - no Strands tools to convert
- ❌ Dead code with no usage

### 2. `src/fivcadvisor/events/bus.py` (254 lines)

**Purpose**: Event bus system for agent execution monitoring

**Classes**:
- `EventType` - Enumeration of event types
- `Event` - Base event class
- `EventBus` - Central event dispatcher
- Various specific event classes

**Reason for Removal**:
- ❌ Not imported or used anywhere in the codebase
- ❌ Not exported from `src/fivcadvisor/events/__init__.py`
- ❌ Events module uses `hooks.py` and `types.py` instead
- ❌ Dead code with no usage

---

## Verification

### Import Checks
```bash
$ grep -r "from fivcadvisor.tools.adapter import" src/ tests/ examples/
# No results

$ grep -r "from fivcadvisor.events.bus import" src/ tests/ examples/
# No results

$ grep -r "EventBus" src/ tests/ examples/
# No results
```

### Module Exports
- `src/fivcadvisor/tools/__init__.py` - Does NOT export adapter functions
- `src/fivcadvisor/events/__init__.py` - Does NOT export EventBus

### Test Results
✅ **All 336 tests passing**

```
============================= 336 passed in 3.23s ==============================
```

## Impact Analysis

### What Was Removed
- 440 lines of dead code
- 2 unused modules
- 0 breaking changes (nothing was using these files)

### What Remains
- ✅ All active event system functionality (`hooks.py`, `types.py`)
- ✅ All tool management functionality (`types/`, `__init__.py`)
- ✅ All agent functionality
- ✅ All tests passing

---

## Conclusion

Successfully removed 440 lines of dead code that was created during the adapter removal phase but never actually used. The codebase is now cleaner and more maintainable.

**Status**: ✅ Ready for production
