## Interface Layout

The web interface uses a modern, responsive two-column layout:

- **Left Column (Main)**: Chat interface with conversation history and message input
- **Right Column (Sidebar)**: Configuration panel, graph information, and example queries

## Development

### Running in Development Mode

```bash
# Development mode
make serve-dev

# Or directly with Python
uv run python src/fivcadvisor/app/__init__.py
```

### Customization

The web interface is implemented in `src/fivcadvisor/app/__init__.py` as a single, clean module that:

- Integrates directly with FivcAdvisor's backend
- Provides a modern chat-based user experience
- Supports all graph types and execution modes
- Handles errors gracefully with user-friendly messages
- Uses Gradio's theming system for consistent styling

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Port already in use**: Change port with `uv run fivcadvisor web --port 7861`
2. **Backend not available**: Ensure dependencies are installed with `uv sync`
3. **Slow startup**: First run may be slower due to model initialization
4. **Chat not responding**: Check console for error messages and ensure API keys are configured

### Getting Help

- Check the terminal output for detailed error messages
- Use verbose mode for debugging
- Refer to the main README.md for general troubleshooting

## Integration

The web interface integrates seamlessly with:

- **CLI Commands**: Launched via `fivcadvisor web`
- **Make Targets**: `make serve` and `make serve-dev`
- **Backend Graphs**: Direct integration with all graph types
- **Configuration**: Respects environment variables and settings

This provides a unified experience across command-line and web interfaces.
