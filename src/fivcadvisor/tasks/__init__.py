"""
Task creation and management module.

This module provides high-level functions for creating specialized tasks
that leverage agent capabilities for specific purposes:

Task Creation Functions:
    - create_tooling_task: Identify required tools for a query
    - create_briefing_task: Summarize content into a brief title
    - create_assessing_task: Evaluate query complexity and planning needs
    - create_planning_task: Decompose complex queries into specialist teams

Task Types and Models:
    - TaskAssessment: Assessment result with planning requirement
    - TaskRequirement: Tool requirements for a task
    - TaskTeam: Team plan with specialist agents
    - TaskStatus: Execution status enumeration
    - TaskRuntimeStep: Individual agent execution step

Task Management:
    - TaskMonitor: Tracks agent execution through hooks
    - TaskMonitorManager: Manages multiple tasks with centralized monitoring
    - default_manager: Lazy-initialized default TaskMonitorManager instance

All task creation functions return Runnable instances that can be executed
synchronously via run() or asynchronously via run_async().

Example:
    >>> from fivcadvisor.tasks import create_assessing_task
    >>> task = create_assessing_task("Is this complex?")
    >>> result = task.run()  # Returns TaskAssessment
    >>> if result.require_planning:
    ...     plan_task = create_planning_task("Plan this task")
    ...     plan = plan_task.run()  # Returns TaskTeam

    Create a tooling task to identify required tools for a query.

    This function creates a specialized task that analyzes a user query and
    determines which tools are needed to complete it. The task uses a tooling
    agent to evaluate the query and return a structured TaskRequirement with
    a list of required tool names.

    The tooling task is useful for:
    - Tool selection and planning
    - Capability assessment
    - Pre-execution tool validation
    - Dynamic tool binding

    Args:
        query: The user query to analyze for tool requirements.
               Example: "Calculate the average of [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]"
        tools_retriever: Optional ToolsRetriever instance to provide available
                        tools to the agent. If provided, the tools will be
                        automatically added to the agent's toolkit.
        **kwargs: Additional keyword arguments passed to create_tooling_agent,
                 such as model, temperature, max_tokens, etc.

    Returns:
        Runnable: A TaskRunnable instance that executes the tooling task.
                 Call .run() or .run_async() to execute and get TaskRequirement.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If query is empty or None.
        Exception: Any exception from create_tooling_agent.

    Example:
        >>> from fivcadvisor.tasks import create_tooling_task
        >>> task = create_tooling_task("Calculate 123 * 456")
        >>> result = task.run()  # Returns TaskRequirement
        >>> print(result.tools)  # ['calculator']

    Note:
        The response_model is automatically set to TaskRequirement and passed to
        the underlying agent. The agent's create_agent function handles the
        conversion from LLM output to TaskRequirement model automatically.
        The query is prepended with "Retrieve the best tools for the following task:"

    Create a briefing task to summarize content into a concise title.

    This function creates a specialized task that takes content or a query
    and produces a brief, concise summary suitable for use as a title or
    heading. The task uses a consultant agent to analyze and condense the
    information.

    The briefing task is useful for:
    - Generating task titles from descriptions
    - Creating summaries for UI display
    - Condensing long queries into brief labels
    - Content abstraction and summarization

    Args:
        query: The content to summarize. Can be a long description, query,
               or any text that needs to be condensed into a brief title.
               Example: "I need to analyze sales data from Q1 and Q2..."

                        tools to the agent. If provided, the tools will be

        **kwargs: Additional keyword arguments passed to create_consultant_agent,
                 such as model, temperature, max_tokens, etc.

    Returns:
        Runnable: A TaskRunnable instance that executes the briefing task.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If query is empty or None.

    determine its complexity and whether it requires planning (breaking down
    into multiple steps with specialized agents). The task returns a structured
    TaskAssessment with complexity evaluation and reasoning.

    The assessing task is useful for:
    - Query complexity evaluation
    - Planning requirement determination
    - Task routing and orchestration
    - Workflow optimization
    - Capability assessment

    Args:
