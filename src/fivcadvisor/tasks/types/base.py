Task runtime data models.

This module defines the core data models for task execution tracking:
    - TaskAssessment: Assessment result for task complexity
    - TaskRequirement: Tool requirements for a task
    - TaskTeam: Team plan with specialist agents
    - TaskRuntimeStep: Individual agent execution step
    - TaskRuntime: Overall task execution state
    - TaskStatus: Execution status enumeration (imported from Strands)

These models use Pydantic for validation and serialization, making them
suitable for persistence and API communication.
