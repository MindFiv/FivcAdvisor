"""
Agent runtime data models.

This module defines the core data models for single-agent execution tracking
and metadata management. These models form the foundation of the agent runtime
system, providing structured data for agent configuration, execution state,
and tool invocations.

Core Models:
    - AgentsRuntimeMeta: Agent configuration and metadata
    - AgentsRuntime: Overall agent execution state and runtime data
    - AgentsRuntimeToolCall: Individual tool call record
    - AgentsStatus: Execution status enumeration

These models use Pydantic for validation and serialization, making them
suitable for:
    - Persistence in repositories (file-based, database, etc.)
    - API communication and data exchange
    - Type-safe data validation
    - JSON serialization/deserialization

Example:
    >>> from fivcadvisor.agents.types import (
    ...     AgentsRuntimeMeta,
    ...     AgentsRuntime,
    ...     AgentsRuntimeToolCall,
    ...     AgentsStatus
    ... )
    >>>
    >>> # Create agent metadata
    >>> agent_meta = AgentsRuntimeMeta(
    ...     agent_id="my-agent",
    ...     agent_name="MyAgent",
    ...     system_prompt="You are a helpful assistant"
    ... )
    >>>
    >>> # Create runtime instance
    >>> runtime = AgentsRuntime(
    ...     agent_id="my-agent",
    ...     agent_name="MyAgent",
    ...     status=AgentsStatus.EXECUTING
    ... )

Note:
    For agent execution, see AgentsRunnable in fivcadvisor.agents.types.runnables
