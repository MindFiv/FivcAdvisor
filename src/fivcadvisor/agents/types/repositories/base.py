    Abstract base class for agent runtime data repositories.

    Defines the interface for persisting and retrieving agent execution data.
    Implementations can use different storage backends (files, databases, etc.).

    The repository manages three levels of data:
        1. Agent metadata (AgentsRuntimeMeta) - Agent configuration and identity
        2. Agent runtimes (AgentsRuntime) - Individual execution instances
        3. Tool calls (AgentsRuntimeToolCall) - Tool invocations within runtimes
