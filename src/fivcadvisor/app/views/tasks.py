Tasks Page

Provides a task management interface with task execution tracking and monitoring.

This module implements the main tasks view for the FivcAdvisor web interface,
allowing users to create, monitor, and manage multi-agent tasks. The view handles:
- Displaying task list with status indicators
- Showing task team composition and specialist agents
- Rendering task execution steps with real-time updates
- Tracking runtime changes and agent execution progress

The tasks view uses the TaskManager utility for state management and the TaskRuntime
system for tracking execution state and persistence.

        Creates a Streamlit interface that provides task management capabilities:

        1. **Page Title**: Displays the tasks page title with an emoji icon.

        2. **Task List**: Shows all tasks with status indicators:
           - Status badge (PENDING, EXECUTING, COMPLETED, FAILED)
           - Task query/description
           - Task team information if available
           - Execution timing and duration

        3. **Task Details**: When a task is selected, displays:
           - Full task team composition with specialist agents
           - Each specialist's name, backstory, and required tools
           - Task execution steps with agent details
           - Real-time progress updates for running tasks

        4. **Execution Steps**: For each step in the task:
           - Agent name and status
           - Execution timing (start, end, duration)
           - Messages exchanged during execution
           - Error information if step failed

        The interface automatically updates to show real-time progress
        as tasks execute through the agent swarm.
